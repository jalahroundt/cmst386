    <!--How I implemented SASS: I used Microsoft Visual Studio Code to compile my SASS file. 
    SASS has been installed on my computer for a while by installing it using the NPM. I 
    also installed the Line Sass Compiler extension to make it easier to set up the various 
    files. I began by creating a new file named “sassInput.scss” after creating this file, 
    the “Watch Sass” button appears on the bottom navigation panel. I click the “Watch Sass”
     button and it creates the css file and the css.map file. After this, all that’s left 
     to do is link the css file stylesheet to the page a wish to style.-->

                <h3>Explain the importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience. &#40;minimum 50
                    words&#41;.</h3>
                <p>Responsive Web Design allows webpages to be viewed without issues on all devices and platforms.
                    Developers are able to use HTML and CSS to resize a webpage. They can also hide certain components.
                    Without responsive web design you will experience layout cutoff's inconsistent sizing, and more.
                    Webpages that are responsive gives users the freedom of viewing webpages from anywhere without
                    visibility and accessibility issues.</p>

                <h3>Google Analytics provides a wealth of data for free to help assess the success of websites. Describe
                    three different kinds of reports that will tell you what information your target audience is
                    accessing &#40;minimum 100 words&#41;.</h3>
                <h4>Site Speed Overview Report</h4>
                <p>The Site Speed Overview Report tells you which webpages have a long load time, and why. Webpages that
                    load are least likely to be viewed repeatedly. Slow loading pages also decrease the engagement of
                    the specific page. </p>
                <h4>Navigation Summary</h4>
                <p>The Navigation Summary Report allows developers to see what navigation path user take when viewing
                    the site. The reports allow developers to see where users come from, how they get through your site,
                    and where they are going afterwards.</p>
                <h4>Mobile Overview Summary</h4>
                <p>The Mobile Overview Report helps developers locate where the “un-mobile friendly” sections are in
                    their site. The pages that are not mobile friendly will decrease engagement and viewership of the
                    site. </p>
