    <!--How I implemented SASS: I used Microsoft Visual Studio Code to compile my SASS file. 
    SASS has been installed on my computer for a while by installing it using the NPM. I 
    also installed the Line Sass Compiler extension to make it easier to set up the various 
    files. I began by creating a new file named “sassInput.scss” after creating this file, 
    the “Watch Sass” button appears on the bottom navigation panel. I click the “Watch Sass”
     button and it creates the css file and the css.map file. After this, all that’s left 
     to do is link the css file stylesheet to the page a wish to style.-->

                <h3>Explain the ways to implement preprocessing (client-side vs server-side) (minimum 50 words).
                </h3>
                <p>Less and Sass are both CSS preprocessors. A CSS preprocessor is a language that allows CSS to be
                    compiled
                    into regular CSS syntax so that it can be read by any browser that you’re using. These preprocessors
                    can
                    be implemented server-side by downloading or installing the resource by using Node.js then
                    installing
                    the preprocessor on the server using NPM in the command line. These preprocessors can be implemented
                    client side by downloading the raw resource, transforming the raw data, then adding the result to
                    the
                    HTML DOM, instead of letting it render in the server.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Define and describes the mechanisms used in either LESS or SASS: mixins, variables, functions,
                    operators, nested variables (minimum 100 words)</h3>
                <p>Sass allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins and functions. Sass variable works like
                    JavaScript
                    variables. You give them a name starting in the “$” sign and assign it a value. Throughout your Sass
                    file, you can refer to that variable by its name instead of defining the value over and over. Nested
                    rules in Sass allows you to create rules inside one another, so you don’t have to write the same
                    selector repeatedly. Mixins in Sass allow you to create reusable style throughout your sass file.
                    And
                    finally, Sass comes with built in modules that allow you to perform functions inside of your
                    stylesheet.
                    You can use the math function to operate on numbers or variables, and if-then functions to set
                    conditions. </p>
