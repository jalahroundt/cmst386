            <section>
                <h3>Describe how search engines work (minimum 50 words).</h3>
                <h4>There are 3 different types of search engines:</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>Crawler</li>
                    <li>Human</li>
                    <li>Mutant</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>The Crawler engine use automated system to "crawl" the web and document
                    everything that it finds.
                </h4>
                <h4>The Human engine uses actual humans to view, review, and rank tht websites.
                    They then will enter the information they've collected into a database.
                </h4>
                <h4>The Mutant engine (also referred to as the Hybrid engine) uses crawlers to
                    compile data, then use human input to influence the ranking of each website.
                </h4>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags (minimum 50 words).
                </h3>
                <h4>Keywords are the building blocks of language and of search. As the crawler engines document
                    everything on the page, they keep track of the keywords that they find instead of storing all the
                    data. It’s more efficient to store certain keywords in one database then to overload it with
                    everything at once.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Keywords are most important during search because it helps the user sort through the search engine
                    to find specifically what they’re looking for. Keywords dominate our search by matching the keywords
                    to the pages and displaying it to us for easy access.
                </h4>

                <h4>Meta descriptions are also equally important as keywords. Meta descriptions will give the user
                    a general description of the page thatthey are searching before they enter the website. The main
                    function of the meta description is toadvertise the website and draw usersto the site as a result.
                </h4>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links (minimum 50 words).
                </h3>
                <h4>Links are comprised of four components:</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>Starting link tag</li>
                    <li>Link referral location</li>
                    <li>Visible / Anchor text of link</li>
                    <li>Closure link tag</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>The links and their components are important because the crawlers need to be able to navigate
                    through the pathways of a website to make sure it is the best fit for the users search.
                </h4>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag
                    (minimum 50 words).</h3>
                <h4>Good heading hierarchy is followed when a page begins with the H1 heading and moves down to the H6
                    heading in sequential order. This mean that H1 will be the main heading, H2 will be the subheading,
                    and so on. By doing this, the headings for each page will be logically placed.
                </h4>
                <h4><u>Here is an example:</u></h4>

                    <p>&#60;body&#62;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &#60;article&#62;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#60;h2&#62;Main Heading&#60;/h2&#62;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#60;h3&#62;Subheading&#60;/h3&#62;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#60;h4&#62;Second Subheading&#60;/h4&#62;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#60;h4&#62;Article Content&#60;/h4&#62;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &#60;/article&#62;<p>
                    <p>&#60;/body&#62;<p>

                <h4>In this example we have a decending header hierarchy with H1 being the main heading of the article,
                    H2 being the subheading of the article, and so on as displayed.</h4>
